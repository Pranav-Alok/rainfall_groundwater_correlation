# Rainfall–Groundwater Correlation Project 🌧️💧

This is a simple yet insightful project to analyze the relationship between **rainfall patterns** and **groundwater levels** in a selected region in India.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To explore whether groundwater levels respond to variations in rainfall over time — and if so, to what extent. This correlation helps in understanding water availability and planning sustainable water use.

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Rainfall Data**: IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) monthly rainfall
- **Groundwater Data**: Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) district/block-wise levels

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV and Excel files

## 🔬 Planned Analysis

- Time series plots of rainfall and groundwater
- Correlation analysis (Pearson/Spearman)
- Lag analysis: How delayed is groundwater recharge after rainfall?
- Simple regional comparison if data available

## 📈 Example Output

- Line charts comparing rainfall and groundwater levels over time
- Scatterplots with correlation coefficients

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Add more stations/regions
- Explore seasonal effects
- Use regression or ARIMA for deeper insights
